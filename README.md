# Design-and-implementation-of-a-1kVA-automatic-voltage-regulator
This project work involves the design and implementation of a 1kVA automatic voltage regulator (AVR). An automatic voltage regulator is a device used to compensate for voltage fluctuations in the mains power supply by maintaining the supply voltage within a constant acceptable range. A digital form of an automatic voltage regulator is designed in this work. The design consists of eight units or sections which include: the autotransformer unit, D.C power supply unit, input voltage sensing unit, output voltage sensing unit, current sensing unit, control unit, switching unit and display unit. The basic principle of operation in this design involves the use of a programmed PIC microcontroller to logically switch a cascade of relays so as to send a given A.C input voltage to the correct tap of a 1kVA autotransformer. This ensures that the given input voltage, which lies between a range of 140 – 260V, is properly regulated in order to maintain a constant output voltage range of 220 – 250V. This automatic voltage regulator has a provision for the display of the input voltage value, output voltage value and load power on an LCD screen for the user. It also includes an overload protection system which protects the device from damage resulting from overload conditions.
